## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Deterministic workflow execution engine with DAG validation and topological ordering
- Hash-chained audit logs (SHA-256) and self-contained evidence bundles for compliance
- Policy-gated capability system — 10 capabilities: `net.fetch`, `db.query`, `fs.read`,
  `fs.write`, `time.now`, `random`, `ui.render`, `llm.call`, `actor.spawn`, `actor.send`
- Replay engine for determinism verification via `EventLog` comparison
- Three reference workflow examples:
  - `llm_code_review` — linear 3-step pipeline demonstrating LLM capability and evidence recording
  - `document_processing` — fan-out/merge 5-step pipeline demonstrating parallel steps and DAG scheduling
  - `customer_support_triage` — approval-gate 4-step pipeline demonstrating human-in-the-loop and conditional pause
- MCP server (`boruna-mcp`) exposing 10 tools over JSON-RPC stdio for AI coding agent integration
- Actor system with `OneForOne` supervision and bounded execution scheduling (`Vm::execute_bounded`)
- `boruna-tooling`: diagnostics with source spans, auto-repair, trace-to-tests, stdlib test runner, 5 app templates
- `boruna-pkg`: deterministic package system with SHA-256 content hashing, dependency resolution, and lockfiles
- Real HTTP handler (feature-gated via `boruna-vm/http`) with SSRF protection for `net.fetch` capability
- CLI binary (`boruna`) with subcommands: `compile`, `run`, `trace`, `replay`, `inspect`, `ast`,
  `workflow`, `evidence`, `framework`, `lang`, `trace2tests`, `template`
- Standard library: 11 deterministic libraries — `std-ui`, `std-forms`, `std-authz`, `std-http`,
  `std-db`, `std-sync`, `std-validation`, `std-routing`, `std-storage`, `std-notifications`, `std-testing`
- 557+ tests across 9 crates
