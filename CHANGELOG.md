## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Structured resource limits in `boruna_run`** ([#5](https://github.com/escapeboy/boruna/issues/5),
  sprint `0.3-S10`, FleetQ P1). New optional `limits` parameter on the MCP
  `boruna_run` tool accepting `max_wall_ms`, `max_output_bytes`, and
  `max_memory_mb`. Overruns return a typed
  `error_kind: "limit_exceeded"` with a `limit_kind` discriminator
  (`"wall_ms"` or `"output_bytes"`), the configured `limit`, and a
  human-readable `message` — so callers can surface clean per-limit UX
  instead of parsing error strings. `max_memory_mb` is accepted in the
  schema but **not enforced** in 0.3.x (documented as platform-best-effort
  pending Linux `setrlimit` work in a future sprint).
- New `boruna-vm::error::VmError::WallTimeExceeded(u64)` variant and
  `Vm::set_max_wall_ms(Option<u64>)` setter. Wall-clock checked every 1024
  steps inside the execute loop; uses `std::time::Instant` (not
  `chrono::Utc::now()` per ADR 001 determinism contract). Wall-time
  enforcement is wall-clock-keyed and therefore non-deterministic on
  overrun by construction — `max_steps` remains the deterministic
  ceiling; `max_wall_ms` is the operational guardrail.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-25

Driven by [implementer feedback from FleetQ](https://github.com/escapeboy/boruna/issues?q=label%3Aenhancement) (production integrator). This release closes the two P0 adoption blockers; remaining P1/P2 asks are tracked as issues #3–#9.

### Added

- MCP `boruna_run` tool now accepts a structured `Policy` object for the `policy`
  parameter, in addition to the existing `"allow-all"` / `"deny-all"` string
  shorthands. This exposes the per-capability rules (`allow`, `budget`),
  `default_allow` mode (allowlist vs. denylist), and `net_policy` (allowed
  domains, methods, byte limits, timeout) that the VM has always supported.
  See `docs/reference/policy-schema.md` and `docs/reference/policy.schema.json`.
- New documentation: `docs/reference/policy-schema.md` (prose + examples) and
  `docs/reference/policy.schema.json` (machine-readable JSON Schema 2020-12)
  for integrators rendering capability matrices in their own UIs.
- The `boruna_run` MCP tool description now advertises the structured-policy
  capability so AI agents discover it from the tool list directly.
- Multi-target release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that publishes
  static binaries on every `v*` tag for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`,
  `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, and `aarch64-apple-darwin`,
  plus a combined `SHA256SUMS` checksum file. Linux builds use musl so the
  binaries run on Alpine and other libc-minimal distributions.
- `docs/releasing.md` — release process, verification, and rationale for using
  GitHub-hosted runners (vs. the self-hosted runner used by `ci.yml`).
- README install section showing curl-and-verify install.

### Changed

- **Breaking (MCP only):** `boruna_run` now rejects unknown `policy` values
  (e.g. typo'd strings, numbers, arrays) with `success: false,
  error_kind: "invalid_policy"` instead of silently treating them as
  `"allow-all"`. The legacy strings `"allow-all"` and `"deny-all"` continue
  to behave identically.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Deterministic workflow execution engine with DAG validation and topological ordering
- Hash-chained audit logs (SHA-256) and self-contained evidence bundles for compliance
- Policy-gated capability system — 10 capabilities: `net.fetch`, `db.query`, `fs.read`,
  `fs.write`, `time.now`, `random`, `ui.render`, `llm.call`, `actor.spawn`, `actor.send`
- Replay engine for determinism verification via `EventLog` comparison
- Three reference workflow examples:
  - `llm_code_review` — linear 3-step pipeline demonstrating LLM capability and evidence recording
  - `document_processing` — fan-out/merge 5-step pipeline demonstrating parallel steps and DAG scheduling
  - `customer_support_triage` — approval-gate 4-step pipeline demonstrating human-in-the-loop and conditional pause
- MCP server (`boruna-mcp`) exposing 10 tools over JSON-RPC stdio for AI coding agent integration
- Actor system with `OneForOne` supervision and bounded execution scheduling (`Vm::execute_bounded`)
- `boruna-tooling`: diagnostics with source spans, auto-repair, trace-to-tests, stdlib test runner, 5 app templates
- `boruna-pkg`: deterministic package system with SHA-256 content hashing, dependency resolution, and lockfiles
- Real HTTP handler (feature-gated via `boruna-vm/http`) with SSRF protection for `net.fetch` capability
- CLI binary (`boruna`) with subcommands: `compile`, `run`, `trace`, `replay`, `inspect`, `ast`,
  `workflow`, `evidence`, `framework`, `lang`, `trace2tests`, `template`
- Standard library: 11 deterministic libraries — `std-ui`, `std-forms`, `std-authz`, `std-http`,
  `std-db`, `std-sync`, `std-validation`, `std-routing`, `std-storage`, `std-notifications`, `std-testing`
- 557+ tests across 9 crates
